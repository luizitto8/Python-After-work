#a simple function from memory is

def turtles():
    a = 22
    b = 29
    return a * b

#if we wanted to change the values of a & b from above. well we could use parameters. parameters act as place holders.

def turtles(a,b):
    print(a*b)
  
turtles(12,2) #here we are now 'summoning' the function to take action

#below is seperate from above. this is pulled from a tutroial. but good to always practice.

    green = random.randint(0, 256)

#what i am understanding here is that it is generating numerical values and assigining them to a variable that could
#perhaps be utilized later.
